This program will accept a match, declare your character, ban your character, and then lock in your character. At the moment, it doesn't work if your character gets banned, or your teammate wants to play the character you want to ban, or if someone declines the ready check. You also have to have league set to the resolution it's at by default, and it has to be on your primary monitor if you have more than one. You also can't move it around much. I might fix some of these issues at some point, but this project was mostly for fun and I doubt anyone will actually use it so I'm not sure.

The values in the config.ini file should work for 1080p. Below are the values for a few other resolutions that I've tested:

2880 x 1800:
searchx = 900
searchy = 200
characterx = 475
charactery = 250
lockinx = 720
lockiny = 700
acceptx = 700
accepty = 650
windowSize1 = 160
windowSize2 = 200
windowSize3 = 2724
windowSize4 = 1600

2560 x 1440:
